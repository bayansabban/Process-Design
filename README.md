# Process-Design

###### Every website should be designed for the target audience, It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

## Key Motivations:
1. Are they looking for general
entertainment?
2. If there is a specific goal, is
it a persona?
3. Do they see spending time on
this activity as essential?

## Specific Goals:
* Do they need to contact you?
* Are they already familiar with
the service?
*  Are they looking for time
sensitive information?


**GORDON** *bought a tennis racquet several years ago; now he wants to
purchase one from your site for his girlfriend.*

**MOLLY** *has read about your new doggy daycare service in the press and
wants to find out whether it would be suitable for her to use.*

**JASPER** *had a bad experience staying in a hotel when visiting Sydney,
Australia, and wants to make a complaint.*
